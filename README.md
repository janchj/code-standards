# code-standards

Few thoughts to make better later.

* Make all commits have unit tests
* When dealing with code separation, consider:
  - Indirection. (add link)
  - Duplication might not always be a bad thing if benefits are good enough.
  - A balance between intent and comments should be the aim.
